2048 bot using minimax logic.

Might consider some sort of neural network bot in the future but for now that's too advanced. Besides if i get the static evaluation right, there's no reason this shouldn't perform amazingly. Ofc "getting the static evaluation right" isn't going to be a walk in the park, but we'll see what happens.
