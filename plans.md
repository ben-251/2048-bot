When this all works, i can work on defining a better set of weights such that there is an intuitive feel or concrete defintion for what a "draw" or "neutral" position is. At the moment the position could be evaluated to be negative but be good, or positive but be bad. the only way to make conclusions is through comparisons. I can't actually say a position is good or bad, just better or worse. I need to change that.

I also need to find a way to order the possible moves to allow for pruning
